the first 100 even numbers


 public class First100EvenNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int count = 0;
        int number = 2;

        while (count < 100) {
            System.out.println(number);
            number += 2; // Move to the next even number
            count++;
        }
    }
}


from line 4 to line 15 is the code 

now we first declare a variable count with integer as datatype and assigned the value of 0 to it

then another varaible with integer as datatype and an assigned value of 2

now here is where the logic comes in

so using the While loop 

our condition is "(count < 100)"

then our code block 
{
            System.out.println(number);
            number += 2; // Move to the next even number
            count++;
        }

        now the "System.out.println(number);" prints the value in the variable number

then again number += 2; // Move to the next even number

and finally we count++ which will  run the loop again to see if the new value of count is < 100
